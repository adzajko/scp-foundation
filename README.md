## Reimagining of the classic SCP Foundation website, this project aims to provide a similar view to the one a researcher at the foundation would actually see.

**Built using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)**

To start: 
- Install the dependencies for the API and the UI.
- Ensure you have [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) installed. The start-both-at-same-time script won't work otherwise.
- Provide a .env file in the API folder, holding two entries, a PORT entry (8080) and a DB entry which will hold the connection string to your MongoDB.
- Execute the start.sh script.
